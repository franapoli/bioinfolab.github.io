Bioinformatics research activities at the University of Sannio were initiated in 2000 by Michele Ceccarelli and focused on the study of informatic processes in biological systems. As biological data began to grow exponentially, the lab focused toward data science approaches in bioinformatics under the co-direction of Luigi Cerulo from 2009. Starting in 2021, the Bioinformatics Lab has been led by Luigi Cerulo and Francesco Napolitano and employs advanced techniques to explore biological data, predict molecular mechanisms, and identify novel drugs and therapeutic targets, driving innovation in bioinformatics research.
