**Bachelor Thesis**: This thesis focuses on developing a method, called RGDIST, to identify genes that are responsive to drug treatments. RGDIST is based on the assumption that these genes should show the effects of treatment more prominently in the cells closest to the site of drug injection. The study was applied to a spatial RNAseq dataset obtained after injections of heme in the mouse brain, with the aim of simulating intracerebral hemorrhage and evaluating the transcriptional effects of free heme in brain tissue. RGDIST was used to identify genes that are responsive to treatment and proved to be effective in detecting these genes more sensitively than other methods. The significant genes extracted with RGDIST are biologically relevant and consistent with the expected effects of the presence of free hemoglobin and heme.
