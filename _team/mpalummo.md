Martina Palummo graduated from the University of Sannio with a master's degreein Genetic and Molecular Biotechnology. She works in the Bioinformatics lab as a research assistent, studying the methylome, mainly in the oncology field. It has been shown that aberrant DNA methylation represents a hallmark of tumorigenesis and can also influence the effectiveness of antineoplastic treatments, because it alters the expression of genes critical for drug response. Understanding how to use DNA methylation data, through computational models, to predict drug response in cancers can improve personalized medicine and promote the discovery of new antineoplastic agents.
