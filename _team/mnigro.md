Marco was born in Brescia, Italy, and moved to Milan to pursue a bachelor’s degree in Pharmaceutical Biotechnology. During this time, he became fascinated by the field of neuroscience, which led him to pursue a master’s degree in Neurobiology (University of Pavia) and a Ph.D. in Neuroscience and Neurotechnologies (Italian Institute of Technology). Throughout these periods, Marco participated in various research projects, starting with the study of energy metabolism proteins and cellular plasticity in learned helpless rats. He then transitioned to analyzing different isoforms of receptors following transient ischemic attacks and conducting extracellular recordings in freely moving animals during social behavior paradigms in mouse models for psychiatric disorders. Later, he briefly worked as a postdoc researcher in a drug development lab focused on Fragile X syndrome. Afterward, he joined the Yang Lab at the University of California, Riverside, to study the roles of the prefrontal cortex and norepinephrine in cognitive flexibility. Recently, he joined Napolitano’s lab at the University of Sannio to study drug repositioning for Retinitis Pigmentosa using artificial intelligence applied to single-cell transcriptomics.
