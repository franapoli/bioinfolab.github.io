**Bachelor thesis abstract**: The thesis focuses on revDECCODE, a computational method for identifying small molecules through differential profiles, for integration into standard therapies for glioblastoma (GBM) treatment. Glioblastoma represents one of the most aggressive forms of brain cancer, with limited therapeutic options and a poor prognosis. The first chapter introduces the biological context of glioblastoma, highlighting its molecular complexity. The second chapter explores the application of transcriptomics in the context of drug discovery against cancer, specifically targeting GBM. In the third chapter, the revDECCODE method is presented as an approach for identifying small molecules with therapeutic potential in glioblastoma. Through the analysis of differential profiles, revDECCODE enables the extraction of molecules that may act synergistically with standard therapies, improving treatment efficacy and reducing pharmacological resistance. The integration of methods like revDECCODE into therapeutic strategies for glioblastoma offers new perspectives for addressing this devastating disease. The thesis concludes by emphasizing the importance of omics research and analyzing potential future scenarios.

**Internship project**: Development of a geological dataset for the training of machine learning models in Google TensorFlow.
