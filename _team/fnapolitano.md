F.N. is a Computer Scientist with a background in Mathematical Models and Machine Learning. He focused his M.Sc. (University of Salerno) and Ph.D. (University of Salerno and University of California, Irvine) on supervised and unsupervised data analysis, particularly for complex data clustering. Early experience with biological applications came with bioinformatic analysis of cancer transcriptomic and genomic data (University of Chieti-Pescara). Related interest in pharmacological therapy induced F.N. to explore the area of Chemoinformatics. In this regard, he studied the use of automatic classification for drug repositioning based on integrated transcriptomic and bio-chemical data (University of Helsinki, Finland). Subsequently, at the Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine (TIGEM), he focused on the development of computational methods for the identification of small molecules inducing cell-type specific transcriptional programs, with applications to generative medicine and differentiation therapy in cancer. He then joined as a Research Scientist the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) where he applied Deep Learning models to integrated omics data in the context of Drug Discovery and Metabolic Disease Modeling. He is now an Assistant Professor at the University of Sannio, Benevento, Italy, where he teaches Principles of Computer Science and Bioinformatics at Bachelor and Master courses of Biotechnology and Biological Sciences. F.N. developed and published software tools in the areas of Data Analysis and Reproducible Research.
